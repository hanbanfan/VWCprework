      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm Hannah Gray, a stand-up comedian with over 30 years of experience making people laugh. Before I hit the comedy stage, I served in the Navy, where I worked as an aircraft mechanic, fixing airplanes and ensuring they were safe for flight. My journey has taken me from the runway to the spotlight, and now I'm excited to embark on a new adventure in the world of programming.</p>
      
      <p>With my background in technical work and my creative flair for comedy, I'm looking to blend my skills into a new career as a software developer. I believe programming offers the perfect mix of problem-solving, creativity, and logicâ€”just like a great joke. I'm passionate about learning new technologies and using them to build meaningful, innovative solutions. I'm ready to bring my unique perspective and sense of humor to the tech world!</p>
