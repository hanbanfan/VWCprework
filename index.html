      <h2>ðŸŽ¤ About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Hannah Gray</strong>, a seasoned stand-up comedian with over 30 years of experience bringing joy to audiences around the world. Before taking the comedy stage by storm, I served in the Navy as an aircraft mechanic, ensuring every flight was as smooth as a punchline.</p>
      
      <p>Now, I'm setting my sights on a new adventure in the world of programming. My unique blend of technical expertise and comedic flair drives me to create software solutions that are as dynamic and engaging as a live performance. Just like crafting the perfect joke, I believe coding is all about creativity, timing, and a dash of logic. I'm excited to bring my passion for innovation and my sense of humor to the tech world!</p>
